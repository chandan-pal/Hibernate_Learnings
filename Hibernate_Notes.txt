HIBERNATE
	- ORM Tool (Object Relational Mapping)
	- used in data layer of applications
	- implements JPA
	
What is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) Tool:
	- It solves the common problem of saving object from java to a persistent database against a table which generally represents the class schema.
	- It solves the common problem of:
		1. mapping member variables to columns
		2. mapping relationships
		3. handling data types
		4. mamaging changes to object state
		
Steps we generally have to perform without hibernate:
	- JDBC Database configuration
	- The Model(bean) object
	- Service method to create the model object
	- Database design
	- DAO methods to save the object using SQL queries
	
Steps with hibernate:
	- JDBC database configuration (hibernate configuration)
	- The Model (bean) object - Annotations
	- Service method to create the model object - use the hibernate API
	- Database design - Not Needed!
	- DAO methods to save the object using SQL queries - Not Needed!
	
What is a dialect?
	dialect is a configuration for hibernate to know what kind of language to use while talking to database.
	Even though we use SQL to talk to a dabase, but there are some nuiances which are specific to a database.
	The way we use queries in Oracle is different is from the way we run queries in MySQL.
	if we specify the dialect, hibernate will then use that particular dialect to write sql queries.
